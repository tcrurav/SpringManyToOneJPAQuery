# Spring RESTfull Basic example of Many to One Relationship using @Query

It's just that... A simple project to demonstrate the use of Spring in a basic example with a Many to One Relationship and using @Query.

## Getting Started

For the initial steps give a try to my following video:

It's a step by step guide to understand how to make a Spring project implementing RESTFul and JPA accessing MySQL.

For the theory envolving One-to-many relationships in Spring I recommend you:

For the theory envolving @Query in Spring I recommend you:

After that clone this project and try it.

The Database is here:
